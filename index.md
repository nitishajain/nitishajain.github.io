## [About Me](/about/) 

{: .text-justify}
I am a [PhD researcher](https://hpi.de/naumann/people/nitisha-jain.html) at the [Information Systems Group](https://hpi.de/naumann/home.html) led by Prof. Dr. Felix Naumann at the Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam. The focus of my research is knowledge bases and natural language processing.
