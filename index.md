## [About Me](/about/) 

{: .text-justify}

I am a Postdoctoral candidate at King's College London working with [Dr Albert Merono Penuela](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/albert-merono-penuela-1) and [Professor Elena Simperl](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/elena-simperl) at the Department of Informatics. The focus of my research is multimodal representations with knowledge graphs and language models.
