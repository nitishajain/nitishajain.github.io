## [About Me](/about/) 

{: .text-justify}

I am a [Postdoctoral candidate](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/nitisha-jain) at King's College London working with [Dr Albert Meroño Peñuela](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/albert-merono-penuela-1) and [Professor Elena Simperl](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/elena-simperl) at the Department of Informatics. My research is focussed on Responsible AI and Explainable AI with neuro-symbolic methods. I also work on multimodal representations with knowledge graphs and large language models.
