## [About Me](/about/) 

I am a [PhD researcher](https://hpi.de/naumann/people/nitisha-jain.html) at the [Information Systems Group](https://hpi.de/naumann/home.html) led by Prof. Dr. Felix Naumann at the Hasso Plattner Institute, University of Potsdam. The focus of my research is knowledge bases and natural language processing. 


## [Recent News](/news/)

* Attending AKBC 2021 and giving a talk on "Knowledge Graph Representation with Embeddings" at the [USKB workshop](https://uskb-workshop.github.io/). 

* Extended abstract titled "Do Embeddings Actually Capture Knowledge Graph Semantics?" has been accepted for presentation at [KR 2021](https://kr2021.kbsg.rwth-aachen.de/) at the Recent Published Research Track. 

* Research paper titled ‘Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings with Ontological Reasoning’ has been accepted for presentation at the International Semantic Web Conference 2021 (ISWC 2021) [acceptance rate ... ].

* Selected to attend the ACL mentorship series..

* Joining the BCAI as a PhD intern from October 2020 to January 2021.
